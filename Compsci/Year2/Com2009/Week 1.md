- Open source pseudo operating system (sits on top of a standard OS)
- Collection of design/development tools for programming robots (Simulation and visualisation tools)
- Distributed architecture - not just communication between processes but also machines
- Data handling and analysis
- Language independent
- Implementation of standard tools, and interfaces to different problems with the intention of re-usability
- Not an operating system, a programming language or an IDE
